HTTP or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol is a set of rules or protocol that defines how a client and a server should communicate in a World Wide Web. It can be viewed as request-response communincation protocol. Usually, a browser can be seen as a client and web server that hosts the files can be viewed as a server. When a client sends a request the server responds with a response that contains the appropiate status code. HTTP has different methods such as GET, POST,PUT,PATCH,HEAD,DELETE,TRACE etc.

HTTPS is a secured variant of HTTP protocol. It uses secured socket layer (SSL) in order to provide security. In this protocol servers and clients possess predefined code which is used to encrypt or scramble the message that is being transfered. This prevents malicious users from getting hold of the information.
